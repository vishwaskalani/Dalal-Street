- Let us discuss one of the stocks which contribute to a significant amount of our portfolio that is Vesuvius India limited.
- The company has been on a heavy downtrend recently falling a lot post the stock split. Initially the stock touched its all time high of 650 giving us a huge amount of profit but now it is back to the levels of 517. The stock used to consolidate for long periods of time in between 5000 and 5500. The stock historically consolidates for a while and then rockets.
- Recently, The company set up a new Al-Si monolithic manufacturing facility at Anakapalli (Visakhapatnam) with an investment of ₹87.70 Cr, funded via internal accruals. The plant has an annual capacity of 1.20 lakh tons for Al-Si monolithic products. This should soon boost the results of the company and that is one of the key factor which is motivating us to hold the stock. 
- The company has merely 3.4% of its revenues from export activity which keeps it a good bet even in the tarrif uncertainity going across the world. 
- The company has been producing good results since 2020, although last 2 quarters results were not very good. In general if the analysis of stock performance after split helps us to know that even promising comapnies fall post split then it will help us gain confidence on our bet. Or help us take decision of when to exit.
